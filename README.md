## Project Objective
The goal of this test was to create a dynamic list where, upon entering a number in the input field, a list with the exact number of items corresponding to the entered number should appear. For example, if the user enters 7, 7 items should appear on the screen. The entire development was done using only Node.js, EJS, pure JavaScript, and CSS, following the layout provided in the test file as closely as possible. <br>
